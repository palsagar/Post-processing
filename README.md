# Post-processing
A collection of scripts for post-processing data generated from primarily but not limited to simulations of atomisation/fragmentation phenomena. Advanced **GNUPLOT** and **Bview** scripts are also welcome. 


## How to contribute 
All contributors are kindly asked to adhere to the following guidelines in order to ensure an efficient knowledge tranfer.

### For each type of plot : 
1. Create a folder whose name starts with yours *e.g. palsagar_xxxxxx * 
2. Insert the scripts and a sample dataset (small) into the folder. 
3. Include a sample result (plot) of the script in the folder. 
4. Each folder requires an individual README file in mardown format. 

### Details to include in README files : 
1. Simulation details (brief)
2. Dependencies with respect to post-processing *e.g. numpy, seaborn, scipy* 
3. A brief explanantion of the data structure used in the data files.
